# TDD and OOP assessment

Clone the GitHub repository from the button at the bottom of the page.

In this assessment, you will be implementing an online store based solely on test
specs and your TDD/OOP skills.

Make sure to read the specs carefully to understand the requirements and file
structure of the project. Everything you need to know is there.

1. `npm install` to install Mocha and Chai
2. `npm test` to run the test cases

the unit tests crash, or do not run, you will receive a zero for the coding
portion of the assessment
2. Delete the `node_modules` directory
3. Rename your folder to begin with your `firstName_lastName`
4. Zip up your folder
